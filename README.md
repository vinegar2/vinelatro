# vinelatro
A (shitty) Balatro clone entirely using C++

Howdy there! Right now I'm a Freshman Computer Science Major, and I'm bored as hell!
My previous project for my C++ class was to make a (shittier) card game, and I wound up finishing the entire thing in 3 hours. This project is entirely jerry-rigged off of that foundation.
It started as a joke with my friend that I'd turn the project into Balatro, but then I started actually doing it lol. 
This is mostly just for me to practice my own skills, so it's all very much derivative of the actual game.


Well, that's it for the README.md

Bye all!!
